# Emily Sas

Having originally joined comparethemarket.com as a Junior Software Engineer in May 2015, I have since been promoted to Software Engineer. I am committed to writing clean code through test-driven development (upon the subject of which I recently gave a company-wide training day). Whilst I have a background in object oriented design, I am currently learning functional programming via the Martin Odersky course Functional Programming in Scala. I care deeply about code quality and derive great satisfaction from writing elegant code. I am highly pro-active, and enjoy organising talks and events in the workplace. I'm looking for a 4-day per week software engineer position, in an agile environment, that will allow me to build skills in new languages and platforms.


## Skills

### Programming

Whilst I am most familiar with C# (ASP.NET and Web API) and Angular.js, I have a background in Ruby (Rails and Sinatra), some experience of Node.js, have also dabbled with Clojure, and am currently learning Scala. I am committed to practicing both TDD and BDD, following the SOLID principles, and writing clean code. I believe that in following these principles I can help ensure that my code is TRUE (transferable, readable, usable and exemplery) and, more importantly, that it is easy to maintain and to change.

* I am currently a member of the comparethemarket.com Functional Programming Guild, where I am researching the possibility of using Scala as part of our new microservices architecture.
* I am known for writing clean and well tested code.
* I have leapt at the chance to attend training sessions such as: Mobbing with Woody Zuill; Hack Yourself First with Troy Hunt; Behaviour Driven Development with Seb Rose; and training in the use of tools such as Docker, New Relic and Splunk. 
* I am currently enrolled on Martin Odersky's course 'Functional Programming Principles in Scala' via [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-004) in order to gain a better understanding of both Scala and functional programming.

### Problem Solving

I was drawn to studying Philosophy, Law, and more recently Programming, largely through a love of problem solving. I consider myself to be very good at analysing problems, having a good conceptual overview of the issues, and applying a suitable solution.

* I attended and won a hackathon run by Makers Academy but Judged by external VCs.
* I recently formed and led a hackathon team at comparethemarket.com on the subject of Cross Selling.
* I have entered and won a number of debating and mooting competions, demonstrating my ability to approach a problem              strategically, and to think on my feet quickly and calmly.
* Whilst Executive Officer at Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art: I took a critical look at the budget I had inherited and renegotiated contracts resulting in improved efficiencies and substantial savings of c. £3,000pa; and successfully planned and implemented new procedures that led to improved organisational performance.


### Communication and Team Work

I work well within a team and constantly strive both to learn from, and to share my knowledge with, others in order to build the team's capacity. I have actively participated in, and contributed to, a variety of discussions, meetings, and events. I am confident meeting with clients and stakeholders, as well as giving talks, presentations and training sessions.

* Whilst at comparethemarket.com I have gave a Lightning Talk entitled 'How to pair with Juniors' and a Brown Bag on Mobbing.
* I recently prepared and ran a training day on TDD and BDD; attended by Developers, QAs and Tech Graduates from across BGL Group Ltd (the parent company of comparethemarket.com); and for which I received excellent feedback.
* I helped found a Design Patterns club at comparethemarket.com and have taught 3 sessions on individual design patterns.
* I designed and ran a CodeJam competition at comparethemarket.com in order to, by stealth, encourage the use of TDD and the practicing of Code Katas; this proved sucessful and I am planning another one shortly.
* Upon graduating from Makers Academy, I was hired as an Alumni Helper to support those currently on the course. 
* As a volunteer paralegal at Islington Law Centre, I attended and conducted client interviews with a view to obtaining necessary information to support employment law cases.
* Recognised for diplomacy, and winner of the Addleshaw Goddard Debating Competition 2010.
* Managed relationships at all levels within internal and external organisations including government organisations, contractors, and members of the public. 
* Experienced in networking and establishing useful contacts
    
  
### Management

I have experience managing small teams and medium budgets (upto £250,000). I consider communication, planning, and continuous evaluation to be vital to effective management.

* I currently coach a Junior Software Engineer.
* Whilst at Liverpool Biennial, I held regular line management meetings with assistant and apprentice in order to ensure successful working relationship and gauge extent of workload and any training requirements
* I also held regular training sessions with an apprentice in order to fill his skill/knowledge gaps and manage his completion of apprenticeship NVQ


### Autodidactism

I have always loved learning, devouring books, and seeking out opportunities to learn as many varied skills as I can, from: languages to touch-typing, the piano and cello, knitting, baking, and electronics.

* I am currently learning piano and really enjoying it.
* I recently joined the newly formed Functional Programming Guild at comparethemarket.com and have welcomed the opportunity to concentrate on a new language.
* I attend as many tech meetups, hacknights, workshops and conferences as possible.
* During my gap-year in East Africa, I endeavoured to learn Swahili rather than to rely on English (although a National Language), and ended up with a good conversational level in the language.
* I am a self-taught amateur chocolatier, which even led to a couple of commissions
