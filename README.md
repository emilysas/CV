# Emily Sas

As a passionate junior web developer with an particular interest in test driven development and object oriented design, I feel that I can add instant value to a firm through my dedication to agile methodologies and TDD. I love writing elegant code and derive great satisfaction from writing methods that are one line long wherever possible. I'm looking for a part-time position, in an agile environment, that will allow me to learn as much as I possibly can.


## Skills

### Programming

I am equally comfortable in Ruby (Rails and Sinatra) or Javascript (Node.js), and am currently learning Angular.js and C#.Net. I carry out TDD and BDD, strive to follow the SOLID principles, and to keep my code as DRY as possible.

* Working within a team to meet a client brief, I spent the final two weeks of Makers creating a Rails Application heavily reliant on a relational database and a complex and secure routing system: [One Day Experience](https://github.com/emilysas/One_Day_Experience_Prototype)
* During a 2.5 day makeathon, I worked within a team to create an app that used the Twitter API to analyse current trends: [SmartTwits](https://github.com/emilysas/smart_twits)

### Problem Solving

I was drawn to studying Philosophy, Law, and more recently Programming, largely through a love of problem solving. I consider myself to be very good at analysing problems, having a good conceptual overview of the issues, and applying a suitable solution.

* Prior to studying at Makers Academy, I attended and won a hackathon run by Makers but Judged by external VCs.
* I have entered and won a number of debating and mooting competions, demonstrating my ability to approach a problem              strategically, and to think on my feet quickly and calmly.
* Whilst Executive Officer at Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art: I took a critical look at the budget I had inherited and renegotiated contracts resulting in improved efficiencies and substantial savings of c. £3,000pa; and successfully planned      and implemented new procedures that led to improved organisational performance.


### Communication and Team Work

I work well within a team and constantly strive both to learn from, and to share my knowledge with, others in order to build the team's capacity. I have actively participated in, and contributed to, a variety of discussions and meetings, and am confident meeting with clients and stakeholders.

* Upon graduating from Makers Academy, I was hired as an Alumni Helper to support those currently on the course. 
* As a volunteer paralegal at Islington Law Centre, I attended and conducted client interviews with a view to obtaining necessary information to support employment law cases.
* Recognised for diplomacy, and winner of the Addleshaw Goddard Debating Competition 2010.
* Managed relationships at all levels within internal and external organisations including government organisations, contractors, and members of the public. 
* Experienced in networking and establishing useful contacts
    
  
### Management

I have experience managing small teams and medium budgets (upto £250,000). I consider communication, planning, and continuous evaluation to be vital to effective management.

* Whilst at Liverpool Biennial, I held regular line management meetings with assistant and apprentice in order to ensure successful working relationship and gauge extent of workload and any training requirements
* I also held regular training sessions with an apprentice in order to fill his skill/knowledge gaps and manage his completion of apprenticeship NVQ
